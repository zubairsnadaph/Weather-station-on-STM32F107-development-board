# Weather-station-on-STM32F107-development-board
Running on STM32F107 with uC/OS-III RTOS the objective of this project was to develop a weather station which would read, process and post real time data. The code for station is based on preemptive multithreading algorithm which has PktParser and Payload threads. It uses RS-232 thus custom designed interrupt based UART driver to communicate between sensor node and station. It uses 8 bit addresses (0-255), out of which address 1 is for node and address 2 is for station. Since the alogrithm comprises of only two threads hence the communication between them is done using buffer pair. To avoid starvation appropriate semaphores are utilized. The source code for station, terminal emulator to send or receive packet and the weather packets have been attached with this repository.
